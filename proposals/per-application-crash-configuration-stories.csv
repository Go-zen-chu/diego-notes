87479698,When creating a DesiredLRP I can specify a Crash Restart Policy,crash-restart-policy,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Feb 2, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"This story is purely about the Receptor API - nothing is actually going to use these values yet...

```
DesiredLRP.CrashRestartPolicy = {
    NumberOfImmediateRestarts: 3,
    MaxSecondsBetweenRestarts: 960,
    MaxRestartAttempts: 200   
}
```

The Receptor applies the following validations:

- `NumberOfImmediateRestarts`:
    + Allowed to be `0` (means ""never restart immediately"")
    + Must be less than `MaxRestartAttempts`
    + Must be less than `10`
- `MaxSecondsBetweenRestarts`:
    + Must be greater than `30` seconds
- `MaxRestartAttempts`
    + Allowed to be 0 (means ""never stop restarting"")

`CrashRestartPolicy` is optional.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479698,,,
87479700,Diego honors the `CrashRestartPolicy` on a DesiredLRP when determining whether or not to restart an `ActualLRP`,crash-restart-policy,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Feb 2, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"Currently, Diego relies on the hard-coded default `CrashRestartPolicy` in runtime-schema.  Instead, if the DesiredLRP has a `CrashRestartPolicy` Diego should use that policy.

If the DesiredLRP has no `CrashRestartPolicy`, Diego should use the hard-coded default.

> This affects both the Rep and the Converger but if we've done our homework, the change should be purely in Runtime-Schema.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479700,,,
87479702,I can update a DesiredLRP's crash policy,crash-restart-policy,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Feb 2, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,The `DesiredLRPUpdateRequest` should support modifying the `CrashRestartPolicy`.  Note that no further action needs to be taken.  Runtime-Schema always looks up the `CrashRestartPolicy` on the Desired LRP when taking actions.,https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479702,,,
87479704,The `DefaultCrashRestartPolicy` is stored in the BBS and can be modified via the Receptor API on a per-domain basis.,crash-restart-policy,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Feb 2, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"When upserting a Domain, I should be able to specify an optional `DefaultCrashRestartPolicy` on the Domain.

When determining whether or not to restart the application Diego should do the following:

- Use the `CrashRestartPolicy` on the `DesiredLRP`
- If there is none, use the `DefaultCrashRestartPolicy` associated with the LRP's `domain`
- If there is none, fallback on using the hard-coded `CrashRestartPolicy` in runtime-schema",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479704,,,
87479706,As a CF Admin I can CRUD the `DefaultCrashRestartPolicy` using the CC API,crash-restart-policy,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Feb 2, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"This should end up in the CCDB.

To flow this into Diego and keep Diego in sync with CF, NSYNC's bulker should fetch the `DefaultCrashRestartPolicy` and update it when it upserts the domain.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479706,,,

This should emit a desire message to NSYNC's listener, which should update the `CrashRestartPolicy` associated with the `DesiredLRP`.

In addition, NSYNC's bukler should eventually sync changes associated with `CrashRestartPolicy` (i.e. this should modify the etag associated with the applications in the space).",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87479710,,,
