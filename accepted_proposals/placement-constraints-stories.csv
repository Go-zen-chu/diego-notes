90748240,"As a consumer of the Receptor API, I should be able to specify a Constraint when requesting a Task or DesiredLRP",placement-constraints,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Mar 19, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"1. A constraint looks like:

```
type Constraint struct{
    Require []string,
}
```

2. Cells (in particular, the Rep) should be BOSH configurable with a list of `Tags`.

3. When scheduling the DesiredLRP/Task the auction should only allocate the application on Cells that satisfy the constraint.  If there are no Cells that satisfy the Constraint, the Auctioneer should attach a `diego_errors.CELL_MISMATCH_MESSAGE` placement error.

To satisfy the constraint a Cell **MUST** have any tags in the `Require` list

4. Empty Constraints are allowed.

5. The Constraint cannot be modified on a `DesiredLRP`

90748244,"As a consumer of the CC API, I can CRUD PlacementConstraint rules",placement-constraints,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Mar 19, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"This should mirror the organizational structure of [Application Security Groups](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/203/).

After this story I can:

- Create a PlacementConstraint
- Delete a PlacementConstraint
- List all PlacementConstraints
- Retrieve a Particular PlacementConstraint
- Update a PlacementConstraint

Add this point these are just objects in CCDB.  No behavior changes (other than the presence of this new API).

**PlacementConstraints should be under the `/v3` API**",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90748244,,,
90748246,"As a consumer of the CC API, I can associate a PlacementConstraint with a Space (Staging)",placement-constraints,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Mar 19, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"A space can have one Staging PlacementConstraint.  The staging tasks for applications in this space should be run on Cells that satisfy this constraint.

After this story I can (If this is not what CC's DSL naturally gives us by default let me know):

- Retrieve the Staging PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Associate a PlacementConstraint as the Staging PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Disassociate a PlacementConstraint as the Staging PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Given a PlacementConstraint, list all Spaces that have it as a Staging PlacementConstraint 

Behaviorally:

- If a Space has an associated PlacementConstraint then Diego should be informed of the PlacementConstraint when the staging task is created.
- If a Space has no associated PlacementConstraint there should be no PlacementConstraint sent to Diego.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90748246,,,

",placement-constraints,,,,feature,,unscheduled,"Mar 19, 2015",,,Onsi Fakhouri,"A space can have one Running PlacementConstraint.  The staging tasks for applications in this space should be run on Cells that satisfy this constraint.

After this story I can (If this is not what CC's DSL naturally gives us by default let me know):

- Retrieve the Running PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Associate a PlacementConstraint as the Running PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Disassociate a PlacementConstraint as the Running PlacementConstraint for a Space
- Given a PlacementConstraint, list all Spaces that have it as a Running PlacementConstraint 

Behaviorally:

- If a Space has an associated PlacementConstraint then Diego should be informed of the PlacementConstraint when the DesiredLRP is created.
- If a Space has no associated PlacementConstraint there should be no PlacementConstraint sent to Diego.

Changing the PlacementConstraint associated with a space is allowed.  At this point the applications in the space need to be restarted but CC has no way to orchestrate this.  The same issue exists with the Application Security Groups.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90748666,,,
